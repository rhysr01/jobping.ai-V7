# ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Show Your Code to a Senior Developer

## ðŸ“‚ Key Files to Highlight

### **1. Start Here**:
- `CODE-REVIEW-REPORT.md` - Full audit results (Grade: A-)
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `PRODUCTION-READY.md` - Deployment readiness

### **2. Architecture**:
- `app/page.tsx` - Clean composition
- `app/api/webhook-tally/route.ts` - Instant matching implementation
- `components/sections/` - Modular UI components

### **3. Core Features**:
- `app/api/match-users/route.ts` - AI job matching (400+ lines)
- `Utils/email/templates.ts` - Branded email system
- `app/upgrade/page.tsx` - Payment flow

### **4. Quality**:
- `tests/e2e/user-journey.spec.ts` - 26 E2E tests
- `scripts/senior-dev-e2e-checklist.sh` - 27/27 tests passed

## ðŸ’¬ TALKING POINTS

### **"Tell me about your tech stack"**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Redis rate limiting
- **Payments**: Stripe (checkout sessions, webhooks)
- **Email**: Resend with engagement tracking
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E, Jest unit tests
- **Deployment**: Vercel with auto-deploy from GitHub

### **"What's the core feature?"**
Instant AI job matching:
1. User signs up via Tally form
2. Webhook triggers AI matching within seconds
3. User receives 5 hand-picked jobs in < 30 seconds
4. Then continues on schedule (1x or 3x weekly)

### **"How do you ensure quality?"**
- E2E tests across all browsers (26 tests)
- Unit tests for matching logic
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Webhook signature validation
- Engagement tracking (pauses emails if user inactive)

### **"Show me something impressive"**
1. **Instant matching** - Most competitors send first email next day
2. **Design consistency** - Purple vignette across site + emails
3. **Engagement system** - Auto-pauses for inactive users, re-engages
4. **Security** - Rate limiting, validation, proper auth everywhere

### **"What would you improve?"**
Be honest:
- 54 unused monitoring variables (planned observability)
- Test file type errors (doesn't affect production)
- Some scraper TODOs (future features)
- Would add Sentry for error tracking

## ðŸ’¡ IF THEY ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS

### **"Why so many unused variables?"**
"They're for monitoring/observability - I built the infrastructure for metrics collection but haven't connected the dashboard yet. They don't affect performance and make it easy to add monitoring later."

### **"Why Tally instead of custom form?"**
"MVP speed - Tally let me validate the concept in days instead of weeks. If we get traction, we'll build a custom form. Right now, testing product-market fit is more important than owning the form."

### **"Why only 5 jobs per email?"**
"Quality over quantity - students are overwhelmed by job boards. 5 hand-picked roles feels curated, drives higher click-through rates, and caps our AI costs. It's a feature, not a limitation."

### **"What's your biggest technical risk?"**
"AI matching costs scale linearly with users. At 1000 users Ã— 3 emails/week, that's ~â‚¬2k/month in OpenAI costs. We'd need to optimize the prompts or switch to fine-tuned models around 500 users."
