./cleanup-scripts/master-cleanup.sh
```
*Interactive menu to choose what to clean*

### **Option 2: Run Individual Scripts**
```bash
# Find current issues
./cleanup-scripts/find-abandoned-code.sh

# Clean specific problems
./cleanup-scripts/clean-console-logs.sh

    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-imports": "error"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
