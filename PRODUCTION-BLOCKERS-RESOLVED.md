- ‚úÖ Development vs production logging strategies

#### **Usage:**
```bash
# Monitor errors in real-time
tail -f logs/app.log | grep '"level":"error"'

# Check business metrics
grep "CLEANUP_METRICS" logs/app.log | jq
```

## ‚úÖ 2. DATABASE CLEANUP - COMPLETE

### **Problem:** No cleanup for old jobs, database will hit limits
### **Solution:** Automated cleanup system with 90-day retention

#### **What Was Built:**

  - Removes jobs older than 90 days (configurable)
  - Batch processing with safety limits
  - Comprehensive error tracking and recovery
  - Performance monitoring and reporting
  - Dry-run mode for safe testing

- **Database Optimization** (`scripts/optimize-database-indexes.sql`)
  - Performance indexes for cleanup queries
  - Composite indexes for job matching
  - Analytics and monitoring indexes
  - Automated index maintenance

- **API Endpoint** (`app/api/admin/cleanup-jobs/route.ts`)
  - Secure admin authentication
  - Real-time cleanup execution
  - Safety checks and rollback capabilities
  - Structured logging and metrics

- **Automated Scheduling** (`scripts/schedule-cleanup.sh`)
  - Cron-compatible scheduler
  - Health checks and monitoring
  - Multiple authentication methods
  - Comprehensive logging and alerting

#### **Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ 90-day job retention (configurable)
- ‚úÖ Safety threshold: won't delete >15% of jobs in one run
- ‚úÖ Batch processing: 500 jobs per batch to avoid DB overload
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and metrics
- ‚úÖ Multiple execution methods (script, API, cron)

#### **Usage:**
```bash
# Run cleanup (dry-run first)
npm run cleanup:jobs:dry-run
npm run cleanup:jobs

# Schedule daily cleanup at 2 AM
echo "0 2 * * * cd /path/to/jobping && npm run cleanup:schedule" | crontab

# Monitor via API
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/cleanup-jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -d '{"dryRun": true}'
```

## ‚úÖ 3. USER ONBOARDING - COMPLETE

### **Problem:** Email verification issues, no active user tracking
### **Solution:** End-to-end tested onboarding flow

#### **What Was Built:**
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`scripts/test-user-onboarding-flow.js`)
  - Complete signup ‚Üí verify ‚Üí email flow testing
  - Database state validation at each step
  - Email delivery confirmation
  - Performance monitoring
  - Automatic cleanup of test data

- **Enhanced Error Handling**
  - Improved error messages in verification flow
  - Better logging for debugging issues
  - Timeout handling for email operations
  - Graceful degradation for service failures

- **Flow Validation**
  - Signup via Tally webhook ‚úÖ
  - Email verification process ‚úÖ
  - Welcome email delivery ‚úÖ
  - 48-hour follow-up email ‚úÖ
  - Regular email schedule activation ‚úÖ

#### **Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ End-to-end flow testing with real API calls
- ‚úÖ Database state validation at each step
- ‚úÖ Email delivery confirmation
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and timeout handling
- ‚úÖ Automatic test data cleanup
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error reporting

#### **Usage:**
```bash
# Test complete onboarding flow
npm run test:onboarding

# Check onboarding health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/verify-email

# Monitor user verification status
grep "email.*verified" logs/app.log
```
