ðŸ”’ SUPABASE SECURITY FIXES (Post-MVP)
=====================================

These are NON-CRITICAL for MVP launch but should be fixed eventually:

1. Enable RLS on jobs_backup table:
   ALTER TABLE public.jobs_backup ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

2. Fix SECURITY DEFINER views (change to SECURITY INVOKER):
   - job_matching_performance
   - user_activity_summary  
   - system_performance
   - feedback_summary

IMPACT: Low - these are monitoring/reporting views
PRIORITY: Post-launch (week 2-3)
RISK: Minimal - views are read-only

For MVP pilot: âœ… SAFE TO IGNORE
